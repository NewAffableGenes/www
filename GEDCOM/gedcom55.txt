Dear GEDCOM Developer:
This letter accompanies the final version of The GEDCOM Standard, Release 5.5. Thank you for your
feedback on preceding drafts, especially 5.4. The number of respondents and the depth of suggestions is
greatly appreciated. For the first time, most of the feedback came via email.
Among other things, this release adds comprehensive support for genealogical documentation and formally
defines the valid combinations of tags used by lineage-linked form compatible programs.
If you do not plan to read the entire 5.5 release at this time, please take time to study the following sections:
A. Data Model Chart.
This is a visual summary of the structural relationships between elements of the Lineage-linked form.
This information is not part of the official document, but it provides an important high level
perspective.
B. Introduction (see page 3)
C. PERMANENT_RECORD_FILE_NUMBER (see page 50)
NOTICE: Programs that check cross reference pointers should be modified to expect pointers to
records that are not present in the transmission but are available on a network (future
implementation). These pointers contain a colon (:) character. For the time being, they can be treated
as if the line were not present.
D. Compatibility With Other GEDCOM Versions (see page 57)
E. GEDCOM Product Registration (see chapter 4 page 67)
Needed changes that would cause major incompatibilities with prior implementations were postponed until
release 6.0, some time in the future. Minor 5.x releases may occur in the interim.
Official, current GEDCOM documents are now available by anonymous ftp at ftp.gedcom.org in the
directory /pub/genealogy/gedcom. This includes a postscript and a WordPerfect version of The GEDCOM
Standard, a postscript version of the data model charts, this cover letter, and answers to frequently asked
questions (FAQ).
All future announcements about GEDCOM will be sent via email. To subscribe to our announcement list,
please send email to gedcom@gedcom.org, with the word subscribe in the message area. Those already
added to the list have been notified by email.
Questions and suggestions may be sent via email to gedcom@gedcom.org, by regular mail or by telephone
as indicated on the title page.
Thank you for your interest in The GEDCOM Standard.
Sincerely,
William S. Harten
GEDCOM Product Manager
This release of the GEDCOM Standard contain the following changes which were made subsequent to the
release of the standard dated 11 December 1995 and distributed by mail just before Christmas:

Page 5:
The second bullet item concerning the date definition.
 The definition of the date value was refined to include many of the potential ways in which a person may
define an imprecise date in a free form text field. Systems which guide users through a date statement
should not result in such a precise way of stating an imprecise date. For example, if software was to
estimate a marriage date based on an algorithm involving the birth date of the couple's first child, hardly
needs to say "EST ABT 1881".
page 58:
The third bullet item concerning Multiple Names.
 Multiple Names:
... The same thing often happens with other multiple-instance tags when only one instance was expected
by the receiving system. GEDCOM 5.4 and prior 5.x drafts specified that multiple names should be listed
with the preferred name first. PAF and other products that handle one name only may drop the preferred
name under this arrangement. Therefore GEDCOM 5.5 specifies that the preferred instance of multivalued
information is to be listed last.
page 69:
From the first paragraph.
... To ensure all transmitted information in the Lineage-Linked GEDCOM is uniformly identified the
standardized tags cannot be placed in any other context than shown in Chapter 2. It is legal to extend
the context of the form, but only by using user-defined tags which must begin with an underscore.
page 77:
STAE {STATE}:=
A geographical division of a larger jurisdictional area, such as a State within the United States of
America.

GEDCOM was developed by the Family History Department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday
Saints (LDS Church) to provide a flexible, uniform format for exchanging computerized
genealogical data. GEDCOM is an acronym for GEnealogical Data Communication. Its purpose is to
foster the sharing of genealogical information and the development of a wide range of inter-operable
software products to assist genealogists, historians, and other researchers.
3XUSRVHDQG&RQWHQWRI7KH*('&206WDQGDUG
The GEDCOM Standard is a technical document written for computer programmers, system developers,
and technically sophisticated users. It covers the following topics:
 GEDCOM Data Representation Grammar (see Chapter 1)
 Lineage-Linked Grammar (see Chapter 2, beginning on page 19)
 Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Tags (see Chapter 2, beginning on page 19 and Appendix A, 69)
 Cross Reference of Structures and Primitives (see Appendix B beginning on page 79)
 The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' temple codes (see Appendix C, page 85)
 ANSEL Character Codes (see Chapter 3, beginning on page 63, and Appendix D beginning on page
87)
This document describes GEDCOM at two different levels. Chapter 1 describes the lower level, known
as the GEDCOM data format. This is a general-purpose data representation language for representing
any kind of structured information in a sequential medium. It discusses the syntax and identification of
structured information in general, but it does not deal with the semantic content of any particular kind of
data. It is, therefore, also useful to people using GEDCOM for storing other types of data, not just
genealogical data.
Chapter 2 of this document describes the higher level, known as a GEDCOM form. Each type of data
that uses the GEDCOM data format has a specific GEDCOM form. This document discusses only one
GEDCOM form: the Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form. This is the form commercial software developers
use to create genealogical software systems that can exchange compiled information about individuals
with accompanying family, source, submitter, and note records with the Family History Department's
FamilySearch Systems and with each other if desired.

Earlier versions of The GEDCOM Standard were released in October 1987 (3.0) and August 1989 (4.0).
Versions 1 and 2 were drafts for public discussion and were not established as a standard.
The 5.x series of drafts includes both the first standard definition of the Lineage-Linked GEDCOM
Form and also the first major expansion of the Lineage-Linked Form since its initial use in GEDCOM
3.0. The GEDCOM-compatible products registered as 4.0 systems should still be able to exchange all of
the data that was previously handled by their product with GEDCOM 5.x systems. See "Compatibility
with Previous GEDCOM Releases," (starting on page 57) for compatibility specifics.
4
The following are the expanded purposes of Lineage-Linked GEDCOM :
 Simplify the description of the GEDCOM data representation grammar (rules) for ease of
understanding. (See Chapter 1, starting on page 9.)
 Standardize the valid contexts in which tags, values, and pointers appear in the Lineage-Linked
GEDCOM Form. (See Chapter 2, starting on page 19.) The Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form should
not be confused with other GEDCOM forms, which apply the basic GEDCOM data format but use
different tag, value, and pointer combinations for other purposes.
 Define new data representations for supporting information such as sources, source citations,
repositories, submitter records, submission records, and notes. (See Chapter 2, page 19, for
GEDCOM representation of these support structures as used by the lineage-linked grammar.)
 Define a generic event structure.
 Define a way of associating individuals one to another. This is accomplished through a pointer
which points from one individual record to another with a user-defined relationship description
placed subordinate to this pointer. This feature is not a substitute for handling direct family
relationships. Direct family relationships are represented by the FAMC and FAMS pointers.
 Add a product version number and a GEDCOM form and version number to the HEADer record
structure.
 Define DATE modifiers (FROM, TO, ABT, BEF, AFT, BET) and more rigorously define the
regular date format.
 Define an integration of multimedia within GEDCOM.
0RGLILFDWLRQVLQ9HUVLRQDVDUHVXOWRIWKHGUDIWUHYLHZ
 Added tags for storing detailed address pieces under the address structure.
 Added nickname and surname prefix name pieces to the personal name structure.
 Added subordinate source citation to the note structure.
 Changed the encoding rules and the structure for including embedded multimedia objects.
 Added a RIN tag to the record structures. The RIN tag is a record identification assigned to the
record by the source software. Its intended use is to allow for automated access to that record upon
receipt of return transactions or other reconciliation processes.
 The meaning of a GEDCOM tag without a value on its line depends on its subordinate context for
any assertions intended by the researcher. For example, In an event structure, a subordinate DATE
and/or PLACe value imply that an event happened. However, a subordinate NOTE or SOURce
context by themselves do not imply that the event took place. For a researcher to indicate that an
event took place without knowing a date or a place requires that a Y(es) value be added to the event
tag line. Using this convention protects GEDCOM processors which may remove (prune) lines that
5
have no value and also no subordinate lines. A N(o) value must not be used on an event tag line to
assert that the event never happened. This requires the definition of a different tag.
 Returned the calendar escape sequence to support alternate calendars.
 The definition of the date value was refined to include many of the potential ways in which a person
may define an imprecise date in a free form text field. Systems which guide users through a date
statement should not result in such a precise way of stating an imprecise date. For example, if
software was to estimate a marriage date based on an algorithm involving the birth date of the
couple's first child, hardly needs to say "EST ABT 1881".
 The following tags were added:
ADR1, ADR2, CITY, NICK, POST, SPFX
&KDQJHV,QWURGXFHGRU0RGLILHGLQ'UDIW9HUVLRQ
Some changes introduced in GEDCOM draft version 5.4 are not compatible with earlier 5.x draft forms.
Some concepts have been removed with the intent to address them in a future release of GEDCOM.
The following features are either new or different:
 The use of the SCHEMA has been eliminated. Although the schema concept is valid and essential to
the growth of GEDCOM, it is too complex and premature to be implemented successfully into
current products. Implementing it too early could cause developers to spend a great deal of resources
programming something that would be outdated very quickly. Object definition languages are likely
to contribute to meeting these needs.
 The EVENT_RECORD context has been deleted. This context was intended to support the evidence
record concept in the Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form, which ended up being more complicated
than first supposed. Understanding the difference between the role of a source record and the role of
a so-called evidence record requires further study.
 Non-standard tags (see <NEW_TAG>, page 50) can be used within a GEDCOM transmission,
provided that the first character is an underscore (for example _NUTAG). Non-standard tags should
be used only when structured information cannot be represented using existing context. Using a
Note field is a more universal way of transmitting genealogical data that does not fit into the
standard GEDCOM structure.
 The SOURCE_RECORD structure was simplified into five basic sections: data or classification,
author, title, publication facts, and repository. The data or classification section contains facts about
the data represented by this source and is used to analyze the collection of sources that the
researcher used. The author, title, publication facts, and repository sections provide free-form text
blocks that inform subsequent researchers how to access the source data that the original researcher
used.
 The <<SOURCE_CITATION>> structure is placed subordinate to the fact being cited. It is
generally best if the source citation contains only information specific to the fact being cited and
then points to the more general description of the source, defined in a SOURCE_RECORD. This
reduces redundancy, provides a way of controlling the GEDCOM record size, and more closely
represents the normalized data model.
6
Systems that represent sources using the AUTHor, TITLe, PUBLication, and REPOsitory
descriptions can and should always pass this information in GEDCOM using the SOURce record
pointed to by the <<SOURCE_CITATION>>. Systems that do not represent source information in
these categories should provide the following information as unstructured text using the tags, TITL,
AUTH, PUBL, and REPO, respectively, within the text:
 A descriptive title of the source
 Who created the work
 When and where was it created
 Where can it be obtained or viewed
 Some attributes of individuals such as their EDUCation, OCCUpation, RESIdence, or nobility
TITLe need to be described using a date and place. Therefore, the structure to describe the attributes
was formatted to be the same as for describing events. That is, these attributes are further defined
using a date, place, and other values used to describe events. (See
<<INDIVIDUAL_EVENT_STRUCTURE>>, page 31.)
 The LDS ordinance structure was extended to include the place of a living LDS ordinance. The
TYPE tag line was changed to a STATus tag line. This allows statements such as BIC, canceled,
Infant, and so forth to be removed from the date line and be added here under the STATus tag. (See
<LDS_(ordinance)_DATE_STATUS>, page 45, 46) where (ordinance) represents any of the
following: BAPTISM, ENDOWMENT, CHILD_SEALING, or SPOUSE_SEALING.
 Previous GEDCOM 5.x versions overloaded the FAMC pointer structure with subordinate events
which connected individual events and an associated family. An adoption event, for example, was
shown subordinate to the FAMC pointer to indicate which was the adoptive family. The sealing of
child to parent event (SLGC) was also shown in this manner. GEDCOM 5.4 recognizes that these
are events and should be at the same level as the other individual events. To show the associated
family, a subordinate FAMC pointer is placed subordinate to the appropriate event. (See
<<INDIVIDUAL_EVENT_STRUCTURE>> page 31 and LDS_INDIVIDUAL_ORDINANCE at
page 32.)
 The date modifier (int) was added to the date format to indicate that the associated date phrase has
been interpreted and the interpretation follows the int prefix in the date field. The date phrase is
also included in the date value enclosed in parentheses. (See <DATE_APPROXIMATED>, page
40.)
 The <AGE_AT_EVENT> primitive definition now includes the key words STILLBORN, INFANT,
and CHILD. These words should be interpreted as being an approximate age at an event. (See
<AGE_AT_EVENT>, page 37.)
 The family event context in the FAMily record now allows the ages of both the husband and wife at
the time of the event to be shown. (See FAM_RECORD page 24)
 The <<PERSONAL_NAME_STRUCTURE>> structure now allows name pieces to be specifically
identified as subordinate parts of the name line. Most products will not use subordinate name pieces.
A nickname can now be included on the name line by enclosing it in double quotation marks. Note:
Systems using the subordinate name parts must still provide the name structure formed in the same
way specified for <NAME_PERSONAL> (see page 48.)
7
 A submission record was added to GEDCOM to enable the sending system to transmit information
which will enable the receiving system to more appropriately process the GEDCOM data. The
format currently designed for the submission record was created specifically for TempleReady™
system and for GEDCOM files being downloaded from Ancestral File™. (See
SUBMISSION_RECORD, page 27.)
 A RESTRICTION (RESN) tag and a <RESTRICTION_NOTICE> primitive were added to the
INDIVIDUAL_RECORD context. This allows some records in Ancestral File to be marked for
privacy (indicating some personal information is not included) and some records to be marked as
locked (indicating that Ancestral File will not make changes to the record without authorization
from an assigned record steward).
 The following tags are no longer used in the Lineage-Linked Form:
ARVL, BROT, BUYR, CEME, CNTC, CPLR, DEFM, DPRT, EDTR, FIDE, FILM, GODP,
HDOH, HEIR, HFAT, HMOT, INFT, INDX, INTV, ISA, ISSU, ITEM, LABL, LCCN, LGTE,

SURN, STAT
&KDQJHV,QWURGXFHGLQ'UDIW9HUVLRQ
Version 5.3 introduced the following changes to the GEDCOM standard:
 An address structure was defined.
 A new tag for marital status (MSTA) at the time of an event was added to the event structure. (This
was removed in version 5.4.)
 A mechanism for creating user-defined tags was added. These were defined in a SCHEMA
definition in the header record of 5.3. (SCHEMA was removed in version 5.4.)
 The Unicode standard (ISO 10646) was introduced as an additional character set. (This was reduced
to potential character set in version 5.4. See Chapter 3, page 63.)
 A <<MULTIMEDIA_LINK>> structure was introduced to provide linking and embedding of
digitized photo, video, and sound files. (This was modified in version 5.4. See
MULTIMEDIA_LINK page 33 and MULTIMEDIA_RECORD page 26)
 The source structure NAME tag, meaning the name of the source in the
<<SOURCE_STRUCTURE>>, was changed back to the TITLe tag and is used to show the title of a
book, article, or descriptive title of non-titled sources.
 The <<SOURCE_STRUCTURE>> was changed. Usage of CPLR, XLTR, and INFT tags in source
substructures was discontinued.
8
 The FORM {FORMAT} tag was added subordinate to the PLACe and the GEDCom tags in the
HEADER record and also subordinate to the PLACe tag in the <<PLACE_STRUCTURE>>. The
PLAC.FORM line in the header record indicates that all of the locality names are specified in a
consistent hierarchal sequence as specified by the value of the FORM. For example: 2 FORM City,
County, State. GEDCOM 5.2 used the TYPE tag, subordinate to the PLAC tag instead of the FORM
tag, for this purpose. This provision is for products which have overly structured the place value.

Introduction
This chapter describes the core GEDCOM data representation language.
The generic data representation language defined in this chapter may be used to represent any form of
structured information, not just genealogical data, using a sequential stream of characters.
&RQFHSWV
A GEDCOM transmission represents a database in the form of a sequential stream of related records. A
record is represented as a sequence of tagged, variable-length lines, arranged in a hierarchy. A line
always contains a hierarchical level number, a tag, and an optional value. A line may also contain a
cross-reference identifier or a pointer. The GEDCOM line is terminated by a carriage return, a line feed
character, or any combination of these.
The tag in the GEDCOM line, taken in its hierarchial context, identifies the information contained in the
line, in the same sense that a field-name identifies a field in a database record. This means that the data
is self-defining. Tags allow a field to occur any number of times within a record, including zero times.
They also allow the use of different or new fields to be included in the GEDCOM data without
introducing incompatibility, because the receiving system will ignore data which it does not understand
and process only the data that it does understand.
The hierarchical relationships are indicated by a level number. Subordinate lines have a higher level
number. The hierarchy allows a line to have sub-lines, which in turn may have their own sub-lines, and
so forth. A line and its sub-lines constitute a context or enclosure, that is, a cluster of information
pertaining directly to the same thing. This hierarchical arrangement corresponds with the natural
hierarchy found in most structured information.
A series of one or more lines constitutes a record. The beginning of a new record is indicated by a line
whose level number is 0 (zero).
In addition to hierarchical relationships, GEDCOM defines the inter-record relationships that allow a
record to be logically related to other records, without introducing redundancy. These relationships are
represented by two additional, but optional, parts of a line: a cross-reference pointer and a crossreference
identifier. The cross-reference pointer "points at" a related record, which is identified by a
required, matching unique cross-reference identifier. The cross-reference identifier is analogous to a
primary key in relational database terminology.
*UDPPDU
This chapter defines the grammar for the GEDCOM format. The grammar is a set of rules that specify
the character sequences that are valid for creating the expression of the GEDCOM line. The character
sequences are described in terms of various combinations of elements (variables and/or constants).
10
Elements may be described in terms of a set of other elements, some of which are selected from a set of
alternative elements. Each element in the definition is separated by a plus sign (+) signifying that both
elements are required. When there is a choice of different elements that can be used, the set of
alternatives are listed between opening and closing square brackets ([]), with each choice separated by a
vertical bar ([alternative_1 | alternative_2]). The user can read the grammar components of the selected
element by substituting any sub-elements until all sub-elements have been resolved.
A GEDCOM transmission consists of a sequence of logical records, each of which consists of a
sequence of gedcom_lines, all contained in a sequential file or stream of characters. The following rules
pertain to the gedcom_line:
 Long values can be broken into shorter GEDCOM lines by using a subordinate CONC or CONT
tag. The CONC tag assumes that the accompanying subordinate value is concatenated to the
previous line value without saving the carriage return prior to the line terminator. The CONT
assumes that the subordinate line value is concatenated to the previous line, saving the carriage
return.
 The beginning of a new logical record is designated by a line whose level number is 0 (zero).
 Each new level number must be no higher than the previous line plus 1.
 Logical GEDCOM record sizes should be constrained so that they will fit in a memory buffer of less
than 32K. GEDCOM files with records sizes greater than 32K run the risk of not being able to be
loaded in some programs. Use of pointers to records, particularly NOTE records, should ensure that
this limit will be sufficient. The size of embedded multimedia records can be controlled through
chaining MULTIMEDIA_RECORDS (see multimedia record format on p. 26.)
 Any length constraints are given in characters, not bytes. When wide characters (characters wider
than 8 bits) are used, byte buffer lengths should be adjusted accordingly.
 Level numbers must be between 1 to 99 and must not contain leading zeroes, for example, level one
must be 1, not 01.
 The cross-reference ID has a maximum of 22 characters, including the enclosing at signs (@), and it
must be unique within the GEDCOM transmission.
 Pointers to records imply that the record pointed to does actually exists within the transmission.
Future pointer structures may allow pointing to records within a public accessible database as an
alternative.
 The length of the GEDCOM TAG is a maximum of 31 characters, with the first 15 characters being
unique.
 The total length of a GEDCOM line, including leading white space, level number, cross-reference
number, tag, value, delimiters, and terminator, must not exceed 255 (wide) characters.
 Leading white space (tabs, spaces, and extra line terminators) preceding a GEDCOM line should be
ignored by the reading system. Systems generating GEDCOM should not place any white space in
front of the GEDCOM line.

Grammar Syntax
A gedcom_line has the following syntax:
gedcom_line:=
level + delim + [xref_id + delim +] tag + [delim + line_value +] terminator
level + delim + optional_xref_id + tag + delim + optional_line_value + terminator
for example:
1 NAME Will /Rogers/
The components used in the pattern above are defined below in alphabetical order. Some of the
components are defined in terms of other primitive patterns. The spaces used in the patterns below are
only to set them apart and are not a part of the resulting pattern. Character constants are specified in the
hex form (0x20) which is the ASCII hex value of a space character. Character constants that are
separated by a (-) dash represent any character with in that range from the first constant shown to and
including the second constant shown.

'HVFULSWLRQRI*UDPPDU&RPSRQHQWV
alpha:=
The alpha characters include the underscore, which is used to link word pieces together in forming
tag names or tag labels.
any_char:=
Any 8-bit ASCII character except the control characters found in the range of 0x00–0x1F and 0x7F.
If an @ is desired as part of the line_value, it must be written in GEDCOM as a double @, i.e., "3
doz. @ $20.00" must be stored as "3 doz. @@ $20.00."
delim:=
The delim (delimiter), a single space character, terminates both the variable-length level number and
the variable-length tag. Note that space characters may also be present in a value.
escape:=
The escape is a character sequence in the grammar used to specify special processing, such as for
switching character sets or for indicating an inclusion of a non-GEDCOM data form into the
GEDCOM structure. The form of the escape sequence is:
@+#+escape_text+@+non_at.
Receiving systems should discard any space character which follows the escape sequences closing
at-sign (@). If the character following the escape sequence's closing at-sign (@) is not a space
character then it should be kept as a part of the text following the escape. Systems writing escape
sequences should always output a space character following the escape sequence.
14
The specific format of the escape sequence is defined for the specific GEDCOM form being defined.
escape_text:=
The escape_text is defined to meet the requirements of a particular GEDCOM form.
level:=
The level number works the same way as the level of indentation in an indented outline, where
indented lines provide detail about the item under which they are indented. A line at any level L is
enclosed by and pertains directly to the nearest preceding line at level L-1. The Level L may
increase by 1 at most. Level numbers must not contain leading zeroes, for example level one must
be (1), not (01).
The enclosed subordinate lines at level L are said to be in the context of the enclosing superior line
at level L-1. The interpretation of a tag must be in the context of the tags of the enclosing line(s)
rather than just the tag by itself. Take the following record about an individual's birth and death
dates, for example:
0 INDI
1 BIRT
2 DATE 12 MAY 1920
1 DEAT
2 DATE 1960
In this example, the expression DATE 12 MAY 1920 is interpreted within the INDI (individual)
BIRT (birth) context, representing the individual's birth date. The second DATE is in the
INDI.DEAT (individual's death) context. The complete meaning of DATE depends on the context.
Note:The above example is indented according to the level numbers to make the concept more
obvious. In the actual GEDCOM data, the level numbers are lined up vertically, meaning they
are the first character(s) of the GEDCOM line.
Some systems output indented GEDCOM data for better readability by putting space or tab
characters between the terminator and the level number of the next line to visibly show the
hierarchy. Also, some people have suggested allowing extra blank lines to visibly separate physical
records. GEDCOM files produced with these features are not to be used when transmitting
GEDCOM to other systems.
line_value:=
The line_value identifies an object within the domain of possible values allowed in the context of
the tag. The combination of the tag, the line_value, and the hierarchical context of the supporting
gedcom_lines provides the understanding of the enclosed values. This domain is defined by a
specific grammar for representing a given GEDCOM form. (See Chapter 2, starting on page 19 for
Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form grammar.)
Values whose source information contains illegible parts of the value should be indicated by
replacing the illegible part with an ellipsis (...).
15
Values are generally not encoded in binary or other abbreviation schemes for reducing space
requirements, and they are generally constrained to be understandable by a typical user without
decoding. This is intended to reduce the decoding burden on the receiving software. A GEDCOMoptimized
data compression standard will be defined in the future to reduce space requirements.
Meanwhile, users may agree to compress and decompress GEDCOM files using any compression
system available to both sender and receiver.
The line_value within the context of a tag hierarchy of gedcom_lines represents one piece of
information and corresponds to one field in traditional database or file terminology.
otherchar:=
Any 8-bit ASCII character except control characters (0x00–0x1F), alphanum, space ( ), numbersign
(#), the at sign (@), and the DEL character (0x7F).
pointer:=
A pointer stands in the place of the context identified by the matching xref_id. Theoretically, a
receiving system should be prepared to follow a pointer to find any needed value in a manner that
is transparent to the logic of the subsystem that is looking for specific tags. This highly flexible
facility will probably be used more in the future. For the time being, however, the use of pointers is
explicitly defined within the GEDCOM form, such as the Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form defined
in Chapter 2 (see page 19).
The pointer represents the association between two objects that usually reside in different records.
Objects within a logical record can be associated. If this need exists, the pointer record composition
contains an exclamation point (!) that separates the parent record's cross-reference ID from the
specific substructure's cross-reference ID, which is at some subordinate level to the logical record at
level zero. The cross-reference ID of the substructure subordinate to a zero level record, for interrecord
associations is always composed of the Record ID number and the Substructure ID number,
such as @I132!1@. Including the Record ID number in the pointer that associates objects within a
record will allow the GEDCOM processors to build the index only at the record level and then
search sequentially for the appropriate substructure cross-reference ID. The parent record ID is
assumed when the cross-reference ID begins with a exclamation point (!) signifying an intra-record
association.
Complex logical record structures are divided into small physical records to accommodate memory
constraints, many-to-many relationships, and independent record creation and deletion.
The pointer must match a corresponding unique xref_id within the transmission, unless the colon
(:) character is present (which will be used in the future as a network reference to a permanent file
record). A pointer is given instead of duplicating an object, though the logical result is equivalent.
An expanded traversal of a record tree includes following the pointer to related records to some
depth, and splicing those records (logically) into the resultant expanded tree. Pointers may refer to
either records which have not yet appeared in the transmission (forward reference) or to records
that have already appeared earlier in the transmission (backward reference). This arrangement
usually requires a preliminary pass to construct a look up table to support random access by xref_id
during subsequent passes.
tag:=
16
A tag consists of a variable length sequence of alphanum characters. All user-defined tags, tags
used that have not been defined in the GEDCOM standard, must begin with an underscore character
(0x95).
The tag represents the meaning of the line_value within the context of the enclosing lines, and
contributes to the meaning of enclosed subordinate lines. Specific tags are defined in Appendix A
(starting on page 69). The presence of a tag together with a value represents an assertion which the
submitter wishes to communicate to a receiver. A tag with no value does not represent an assertion.
If a tag is absent, no assertion is made, for example, no information is submitted. Information of a
negative nature (such as knowing positively an event did not occur) is handled through the semantic
definition of a tag and accompanying values that assert the information explicitly. It is not
represented by absence of a tag.
Although formally defined tags are only three or four characters long, systems should prepare to
handle user tags of greater length. Tags will be unique within the first 15 characters.
Valid combinations of specific tags, line_values, xref_ids, and pointers are constrained by the
GEDCOM form defined for representing a given kind of information. (See Chapter 2, starting on
page 19, for the Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form grammar.)
terminator:=
The terminator delimits the variable-length line_value and signals the end of the gedcom_line.
The valid terminator characters are:
[carriage_return |
line_feed |
carriage_return line_feed |
line_feed carriage_return ]
xref_id:=
(See pointer, page 15)
The xref_id is formed by any arbitrary combination of characters from the pointer_char set. The
first character must be an alpha or a digit. The xref_id is not retained in the receiving system, and it
may therefore be formed from any convenient combination of identifiers from the sending system.
No meaning is attributed by the receiver to any part of the xref_id, other than its unique association
with the associated record. The use of the colon (:) character is also reserved.
Examples:
The following are examples of valid but unrelated GEDCOM lines:
0 @1234@ INDI
. . .
1 AGE 13y
. . .
1 CHIL @1234@
. . .
1 NOTE This is a note field that is
2 CONT continued on the next line.
17
The first line has a level number 0, a xref_id of @1234@, an INDI tag, and no value.
The second line has a level number 1, no xref_id, an AGE tag, and a value of 13.
The third line has a level number 1, no xref_id, a CHIL tag, and a value of a pointer to a xref_id
named @1234@.

Introduction
This chapter describes the specific tag, value, and pointer combinations used for exchanging familybased
lineage-linked genealogical information in the GEDCOM format. Lineage-linked data pertains to
individuals linked in family relationships across multiple generations. The chapter also addresses
specific compatibility issues pertaining to previous Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form releases and
contains a sample lineage-linked GEDCOM transmission.
The Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form defined in this chapter is based on the general framework of the
GEDCOM data representation grammar defined in Chapter 1. Commercial genealogical software
systems are invited to use the Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form to exchange data. It is the only form
approved for exchanging data with Ancestral File, TempleReady and other Family History resource files
maintained for this purpose.
Organization
The basic description of the Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form's grammar is presented in the
following three major sections:
 "Record Structures of the Lineage-Linked Form" (beginning on page 23)
 "Substructures of the Lineage-Linked Form" (beginning on page 29)
 "Primitive elements of the Lineage-Linked Form" (beginning on page 37)
The definition of the tags used in defining the lineage-linked structures are contained in Appendix A.
Symbols Used in Chapter 2
The following symbols are used in Chapter 2:
<<double_angle bracket>>
Indicates a subordinate GEDCOM structure pattern of a record, structure, or substructure is to be
substituted in place of the enclosing double angle brackets. The substitute structure pattern is found
subordinate to the LINEAGE_LINKED_GEDCOM beginning on page 24 for record pattern
definition or in alphabetical order under the "Substructures of the Lineage-Linked Form" section,
beginning on page 29.
<Single_angle bracket>
Indicates the name of the appropriate value for this GEDCOM line—<Primitive>. The specific
definition of this value is found in alphabetical order in "Primitive Elements of the Lineage-Linked
Form," beginning on page 37.
{braces}
Indicates the minimum to maximum occurrences allowed for this structure or
line—{Minimum:Maximum}. Note that minimum and maximum occurrence limits are defined
20
relative to the enclosing superior line. This means that a required line (minimum = 1) is not required
if the optional enclosing superior line is not present. Similarly, a line occurring only once
(maximum = 1) may occur multiple times as long as each occurs only once under its own multipleoccurring
superior line.
[Square brackets]
Indicates a choice of one or more options—[Choice of].
| vertical bar |
Separates the multiple choices, for example [Choice 1 | Choice 2].
n level number
A level number which assumes the level number of the line which referenced the substructure name.
+1, +2 ...
A +1 level number is 1 greater than the level number assumed by the superior n level. A +2 level
number is 2 greater, and so forth.
0xHH
Indicates an allowable hexadecimal character value where HH is that value, for example, 0x20
(decimal 32) indicates the space character.
Lineage-Linked Form Usage Conventions
 The order in which GEDCOM lines are written to a GEDCOM file is controlled by the context and
level number. When the lines are of equal level number but have a different tag name then the order
is not significant. The occurrence of equal level numbers and equal tags within the same context
imply that multiple opinions or multiple values of the data exist. The significance of the order in
these cases is interpreted as the submitter's preference. The most preferred value being the first with
the least preferred data listed in subsequent lines by order decreasing preference. For example, a
researcher who discovers conflicting evidence about a person's birth event would list the most
credible information first and the least credible or preferred items last.
Systems that support multiple fields or structures should allow their users to indicate their
preference opinion. Systems that only store single value structures should use the preferred
information (the first occurrence listed) and store the remaining information as an exception,
preferably within an appropriate NOTE field or in some way that the patron has ready access to the
less-preferred data when viewing the record.
 Conflicting event dates and places should be represented by placing them in separate event
structures with appropriate source citations rather than by placing them under the same enclosing
event.
 The Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form uses the TYPE tag to further classify its superior tag for the
viewer. The value portion given by the TYPE tag is not intended to inform a computer program how
to process the data. The difference between this value and a note value is that displaying systems
should always display the type value when they display the data from the associated context. This
gives the user some flexibility in further describing the information provided but does not require
21
the software to recognize and respond to the large variety qualifiers that might be used. For
example:
1 EVEN
2 TYPE Awarded BSA Eagle Rank
2 DATE 1980
 For compatibility, support of multiple calendars using the (#D) escape sequence is still part of the
GEDCOM 5.5 Lineage-Linked Form. Multiple calendar support is not satisfactory and should be
addressed in future GEDCOM releases. As a possible future direction, simplification could be
obtained by converting from a day in a given source calendar to a specific sequential day number
based on some beginning point in time. The receiving system would then convert from that day
number to the calendar day of their choice. The Julian day system is based on a sequential day
beginning from the first day of 4713 years B.C. The Julian day system with an extension that allows
imprecise dates. Later versions of GEDCOM may consider this approach. This approach would also
introduce the idea of the evidence date being shared in the DATE tag and the universal day number
would be passed under a separate tag.
 All controlled line_value choices should be considered as case insensitive.
This means that the values should be converted to all uppercase or all lowercase prior to comparing.
The terms UPPERCASE and UpperCase are considered equal. TAGS are always UPPERCASE.

This is a model of the lineage-linked GEDCOM structure for submitting data to other lineage-linked
GEDCOM processing systems. A header and a trailer record are required, and they can enclose any
number of data records. Tags from Appendix A (see page 69) must be used in the same context as
shown in the following form. User defined tags (see <NEW_TAG> on page 50) are discouraged but
when used must begin with an under-score.

The header structure provides information about the entire transmission. The SOURce system name
identifies which system sent the data. The DESTination system name identifies the intended
receiving system.
24
Additional GEDCOM standards will be produced in the future to reflect GEDCOM expansion and
maturity. This requires the reading program to make sure it can read the GEDC.VERS and the
GEDC.FORM values to insure proper readability. The CHAR tag is required. All character codes
greater than 0x7F must be converted to ANSEL. (See Chapter 3, starting on page 63.)

The FAMily record is used to record marriages, common law marriages, and family unions caused
by two people becoming the parents of a child. There can be no more than one HUSB/father and one
WIFE/mother listed in each FAM_RECORD. If, for example, a man participated in more than one
family union, then he would appear in more than one FAM_RECORD. The family record structure
assumes that the HUSB/father is male and WIFE/mother is female.
25
The preferred order of the CHILdren pointers within a FAMily structure is chronological by birth.

The individual record is a compilation of facts, known or discovered, about an individual.
Sometimes these facts are from different sources. This form allows documentation of the source
where each of the facts were discovered.
The normal lineage links are shown through the use of pointers from the individual to a family
through either the FAMC tag or the FAMS tag. The FAMC tag provides a pointer to a family where
this person is a child. The FAMS tag provides a pointer to a family where this person is a spouse or
parent. The <<CHILD_TO_FAMILY_LINK>> (see page 29) structure contains a FAMC pointer
which is required to show any child to parent linkage for pedigree navigation. The
<<CHILD_TO_FAMILY_LINK>> structure also indicates whether the pedigree link represents a
birth lineage, an adoption lineage, or a sealing lineage.
Linkage between a child and the family they belonged to at the time of an event can also optionally
be shown by a FAMC pointer subordinate to the appropriate event. For example, a FAMC pointer
subordinate to an adoption event would show which family adopted this individual. Biological
parent or parents can be indicated by a FAMC pointer subordinate to the birth event. The FAMC tag
can also optionally be used subordinate to an ADOPtion, or BIRTh event to differentiate which set
of parents were related by adoption, sealing, or birth.
26
Other associations or relationships are represented by the ASSOciation tag. The person's relation
or association is the person being pointed to. The association or relationship is stated by the value
on the subordinate RELA line. For example:
0 @I1@ INDI
1 NAME Fred/Jones/
1 ASSO @I2@
2 RELA Godfather

The sending system uses a submission record to send instructions and information to the receiving
system. TempleReady processes submission records to determine which temple the cleared records

The EVEN tag in this structure is for recording general events or attributes that are not shown in the
above <<INDIVIDUAL_EVENT_STRUCTURE>>. The general event or attribute type is declared
32
by using a subordinate TYPE tag to show what event or attribute is recorded. For example, a
candidate for state senate in the 1952 election could be recorded:
1 EVEN
2 TYPE Election
2 DATE 07 NOV 1952
2 NOTE Candidate for State Senate.
The TYPE tag is also optionally used to modify the basic understanding of its superior event and is
usually provided by the user. For example:
1 ORDN
2 TYPE Deacon
The presence of a DATE tag and/or PLACe tag makes the assertion of when and/or where the event
took place, and therefore that the event did happen. The absence of both of these tags require a
Y(es) value on the parent TAG line to assert that the event happened. Using this convention protects
GEDCOM processors which may remove (prune) lines that have no value and no subordinate lines.
It also allows a note or source to be attached to the event context without implying that the event
occurred.
It is not proper to use a N(o) value with an event tag to infer that it did not happen. Inferring that an
event did not occur would require a different tag. A symbol such as using an exclamation mark (!)
preceding an event tag to indicate an event is known not to have happened may be defined in the
future.

This structure provides two options in handling the GEDCOM multimedia interface. The first
alternative (embedded) includes all of the data, including the multimedia object, within the
transmission file. The embedded method includes pointers to GEDCOM records that contain
encoded image or sound objects. Each record represents a multimedia object or object fragment. An
object fragment is created by breaking the multimedia files into several multimedia object records of
32K or less. These fragments are tied together by chaining from one multimedia object fragment to
the next in sequence. This procedure will help manage the size of a multimedia GEDCOM record
so that existing systems which are not expecting large multimedia records may discard the records
without crashing due to the size of the record. Systems which handle embedded multimedia can
reconstitute the multimedia fragments by decoding the object fragments and concatenating them to
the assigned multimedia file.
The second method allows the GEDCOM context to be connected to an external multimedia file.
This process is only managed by GEDCOM in the sense that the appropriate file name is included in
the GEDCOM file in context, but the maintenance and transfer of the multimedia files are external
to GEDCOM.

The name value is formed in the manner the name is normally spoken, with the given name and
family name (surname) separated by slashes (/). (See <NAME_PERSONAL>, page 48.) Based on
the dynamic nature or unknown compositions of naming conventions, it is difficult to provide more
detailed name piece structure to handle every case. The NPFX, GIVN, NICK, SPFX, SURN, and
NSFX tags are provided optionally for systems that cannot operate effectively with less structured
information. For current future compatibility, all systems must construct their names based on the
<NAME_PERSONAL> structure. Those using the optional name pieces should assume that few
systems will process them, and most will not provide the name pieces. Future GEDCOM releases
(6.0 and later) will likely apply a very different strategy to resolve this problem, possibly using a
sophisticated parser and a name-knowledge database.

The data provided in the <<SOURCE_CITATION>> structure is source-related information specific
to the data being cited. (See GEDCOM examples starting on page 60.) Systems that do not use
SOURCE_RECORDS must use the second SOURce citation structure option. When systems which
support SOURCE_RECORD structures encounter source citations which do not contain pointers to
source records, that system will need to create a SOURCE_RECORD and store the
<SOURCE_DESCRIPTION> information found in the non-structured source citation in either the
title area of that SOURCE_RECORD, or if the title field is not large enough, place a "(See Notes)"
text in the title area, and place the unstructured source description in the source record's note field.
The information intended to be placed in the citation structure includes:
 A pointer to the SOURCE_RECORD, which contains a more general description of the source.
 Information, such as a page number, on how to find the cited data within the source.
 Actual text from the source that was used in making assertions, for example a date phrase as
actually recorded or an applicable sentence from a letter, would be appropriate.
 Data that allows an assessment of the relative value of one source over another for making the
recorded assertions (primary or secondary source, etc.). Data needed for this assessment is how
much time from the asserted fact and when the source event was recorded, what type of event
was cited, and what was the role of this person in the cited event.
- Date when the entry was recorded in source document, ".SOUR.DATA.DATE."
- Event that initiated the recording, ".SOUR.EVEN."

published source, or a keeper of personal collections. An example would be the owner of a family Bible
containing unpublished family genealogical entries. More formal repositories, such as the Family
History Library, should show a call number of the source at that repository. The call number of that
source should be recorded using a subordinate CALN tag. Systems which do not structure a repository
name and address interface should store the information about where the source record is stored in the
<<NOTE_STRUCTURE>> of this structure.

The field sizes show the minimum recommended field length within a database that is constrained to
fixed length fields. The field sizes are in addition to the GEDCOM level and tag overhead. GEDCOM
lines are limited to 255 characters. However, the CONCatenation or CONTinuation tags can be used to
expand a field beyond this limit. CONT line implies that a new line should appear to preserve
formatting. CONC implies concatenation to the previous line without a new line. This is used so that a
text note or description can be processed (word wrapped) in a text window without fixed carriage
returns. The CONT and CONC tags are being used to extend specified textual values.

A unique permanent record number of an individual record contained in the Family History
Department's Ancestral File.
APPROVED_SYSTEM_ID:= {Size=1:20}
A system identification name which was obtained through the GEDCOM registration process. This
name must be unique from any other product. Spaces within the name must be substituted with a
0x5F (underscore _) so as to create one word.
ATTRIBUTE_TYPE:= {Size=1:4}
[ CAST | EDUC | NATI | OCCU | PROP | RELI | RESI | TITL ]
An attribute which may have caused name, addresses, phone numbers, family listings to be recorded.
Its application is in helping to classify sources used for information.
AUTOMATED_RECORD_ID:= {Size=1:12}
A unique record identification number assigned to the record by the source system. This number is
intended to serve as a more sure means of identification of a record between two interfacing systems.
CASTE_NAME:= {Size=1:90}
A name assigned to a particular group that this person was associated with, such as a particular racial
group, religious group, or a group with an inherited status.
CAUSE_OF_EVENT:= {Size=1:90}
Used in special cases to record the reasons which precipitated an event. Normally this will be used
subordinate to a death event to show cause of death, such as might be listed on a death certificate.
CERTAINTY_ASSESSMENT:= {Size=1:1}
[ 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 ]
The QUAY tag's value conveys the submitter's quantitative evaluation of the credibility of a piece of
information, based upon its supporting evidence. Some systems use this feature to rank multiple
39
conflicting opinions for display of most likely information first. It is not intended to eliminate the
receiver's need to evaluate the evidence for themselves.
0 = Unreliable evidence or estimated data
1 = Questionable reliability of evidence (interviews, census, oral genealogies, or potential for bias
for example, an autobiography)

CHANGE_DATE:= {Size=10:11}
<DATE_EXACT>
The date that this data was changed.
CHARACTER_SET:= {Size=1:8}
[ ANSEL | UNICODE | ASCII ]
A code value that represents the character set to be used to interpret this data. The default character
set is ANSEL, which includes ASCII as a subset. UNICODE is not widely supported by most
operating systems; therefore, GEDCOM produced using the UNICODE character set will be limited
in acceptance for some time. See Chapter 3, starting on page 63. ASCII contains the character set
from 0x0 to 0xFF.
Note:The IBMPC character set is not allowed. This character set cannot be interpreted properly
without knowing which code page the sender was using.

The known number of children of this individual from all marriages or, if subordinate to a family
record, the reported number of children known to belong to this family, regardless of whether the
associated children are represented in the corresponding structure. This is not necessarily the count of
children listed in a family structure.
COUNT_OF_MARRIAGES:= {Size=1:3}
The number of different families that this person was known to have been a member of as a spouse or
parent, regardless of whether the associated families are represented in the GEDCOM file.

CAL = Calculated mathematically, for example, from an event date and age.
EST = Estimated based on an algorithm using some other event date.
DATE_CALENDAR:= {Size=4:35}
[ <DATE_GREG> | <DATE_JULN> | <DATE_HEBR> | <DATE_FREN> |
<DATE_FUTURE> ]
The selection is based on the <DATE_CALENDAR_ESCAPE> that precedes the
<DATE_CALENDAR> value immediately to the left. If <DATE_CALENDAR_ESCAPE> doesn't
appear at this point, then @#DGREGORIAN@ is assumed. No future calendar types will use words
(e.g., month names) from this list: FROM, TO, BEF, AFT, BET, AND, ABT, EST, CAL, or INT.
When only a day and month appears as a DATE value it is considered a date phrase and not a valid
date form.
Date Escape Syntax Selected

DATE_LDS_ORD:= {Size=4:35}
<DATE_VALUE>
LDS ordinance dates use only the Gregorian date and most often use the form of day, month, and
year. Only in rare instances is there a partial date. The temple tag and code should always accompany
temple ordinance dates. Sometimes the LDS_(ordinance)_DATE_STATUS is used to indicate that an
ordinance date and temple code is not required, such as when BIC is used. (See
LDS_(ordinance)_DATE_STATUS definitions beginning on page 45.)
DATE_PERIOD:= {Size=7:35}
[
FROM <DATE> |
TO <DATE> |
FROM <DATE> TO <DATE>
]
Where:
FROM = Indicates the beginning of a happening or state.
TO = Indicates the ending of a happening or state.
Examples:
FROM 1904 to 1915
= The state of some attribute existed from 1904 to 1915 inclusive.
FROM 1904
= The state of the attribute began in 1904 but the end date is unknown.
TO 1915
= The state ended in 1915 but the begin date is unknown.
DATE_PHRASE:= {Size=1:35}
(<TEXT>)
Any statement offered as a date when the year is not recognizable to a date parser, but which gives
information about when an event occurred. The date phrase is enclosed in matching parentheses.
DATE_RANGE:= {Size=8:35}
[
BEF <DATE> |
AFT <DATE> |
BET <DATE> AND <DATE>
]
Where:
AFT = Event happened after the given date.
42
BEF = Event happened before the given date.
BET = Event happened some time between date 1 AND date 2. For example, bet 1904 and 1915
indicates that the event state (perhaps a single day) existed somewhere between 1904 and
1915 inclusive.
The date range differs from the date period in that the date range is an estimate that an event
happened on a single date somewhere in the date range specified.
The following are equivalent and interchangeable:
Short form Long Form
---------— ---------—-
1852 BET 1 JAN 1852 AND 31 DEC 1852
1852 BET 1 JAN 1852 AND DEC 1852
1852 BET JAN 1852 AND 31 DEC 1852
1852 BET JAN 1852 AND DEC 1852
JAN 1920 BET 1 JAN 1920 AND 31 JAN 1920
DATE_VALUE:= {Size=1:35}
[
<DATE> |
<DATE_PERIOD> |
<DATE_RANGE>
<DATE_APPROXIMATED> |
INT <DATE> (<DATE_PHRASE>) |
(<DATE_PHRASE>)
]
The DATE_VALUE represents the date of an activity, attribute, or event where:
INT = Interpreted from knowledge about the associated date phrase included in parentheses.
An acceptable alternative to the date phrase choice is to use one of the other choices such as
<DATE_APPROXIMATED> choice as the DATE line value and then include the
<DATE_PHRASE> as a NOTE value subordinate to the DATE line.
The date value can take on the date form of just a date, an approximated date, between a date and
another date, and from one date to another date. The preferred form of showing date imprecision, is
to show, for example, MAY 1890 rather than ABT 12 MAY 1890. This is because limits have not
been assigned to the precision of the prefixes such as ABT or EST.
DAY:= {Size=1:2}
dd
Day of the month, where dd is a numeric digit whose value is within the valid range of the days for
the associated calendar month.
DESCRIPTIVE_TITLE:= {Size=1:248}
The title of a work, record, item, or object.
DIGIT:= {Size=1:1}
A single digit (0-9).
43
ENCODED_MULTIMEDIA_LINE:= {Size=1:87}
A line from a multimedia object which has been ENCODED. Each 54 characters of the multimedia
object is encoded and stored in a 72 byte value. The encoding algorithm is used to convert binary
objects into legal ASCII values which can be transmitted. See the encoding and decoding algorithms
that are defined in Appendix E on page 91.
ENTRY_RECORDING_DATE:= {Size=1:90}
<DATE_VALUE>

[ <EVENT_TYPE_INDIVIDUAL> |
<EVENT_TYPE_FAMILY> |
<ATTRIBUTE_TYPE> ]
A code that classifies the principal event or happening that caused the source record entry to be
created. If the event or attribute doesn't translate to one of these tag codes, then a user supplied code
is expected, but will be considered as the generic tag EVEN for source certainty evaluation.
EVENT_DESCRIPTOR:= {Size=1:90}
A descriptor that should be used whenever the EVEN tag is used to define the event being cited. For
example, if the event was a purchase of a residence, the EVEN tag would be followed by a
subordinate TYPE tag with the value "Purchased Residence." Using this descriptor with any of the
other defined event tags basically classifies the basic definition of the associated tag but does not
change its basic process. The form of using the TYPE tag with defined event tags has not been used
by very many products. The MARR tag could be subordinated with a TYPE tag and
EVENT_DESCRIPTOR value of Common Law. Other possible descriptor values might include
"Childbirth—unmarried," "Common Law," or "Tribal Custom," for example. The event descriptor
should use the same word or phrase and in the same language, when possible, as was used by the
recorder of the event. Systems that display data from the GEDCOM form should be able to display
the descriptor value in their screen or printed output.
EVENT_TYPE_CITED_FROM:= {SIZE=1:15}
[ <EVENT_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE> ]
A code that indicates the type of event which was responsible for the source entry being recorded.
For example, if the entry was created to record a birth of a child, then the type would be BIRT
regardless of the assertions made from that record, such as the mother's name or mother's birth date.
This will allow a prioritized best view choice and a determination of the certainty associated with the
source used in asserting the cited fact.
EVENT_TYPE_FAMILY:= {Size=3:4}
[ ANUL | CENS | DIV | DIVF | ENGA | MARR |
MARB | MARC | MARL | MARS | EVEN ]
A code used to indicate the type of family event. The definition is the same as the corresponding
event tag defined in Appendix A. (See Appendix A, starting on page 69).

RETI | PROB | WILL | EVEN ]
A code used to indicate the type of family event. The definition is the same as the corresponding
event tag defined in Appendix A. (See Appendix A, starting on page 69).
EVENTS_RECORDED:= {Size=1:90}
[<EVENT_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE> |
<EVENTS_RECORDED>, <EVENT_ATTRIBUTE_TYPE>]
An enumeration of the different kinds of events that were recorded in a particular source. Each
enumeration is separated by a comma. Such as a parish register of births, deaths, and marriages
would be BIRT, DEAT, MARR.

[ LINEAGE-LINKED ]
The GEDCOM form used to construct this transmission. There maybe other forms used such as
CommSoft's "EVENT_LINEAGE_LINKED" but these specifications define only the LINEAGELINKED
Form. Systems will use this value to specify GEDCOM compatible with these
specifications.
GENERATIONS_OF_ANCESTORS:= {Size=1:4}
The number of generations of ancestors included in this transmission. This value is usually provided
when FamilySearch programs build a GEDCOM file for a patron requesting a download of ancestors.
GENERATIONS_OF_DESCENDANTS:= {Size=1:4}

]
The surname of an individual, if known, is enclosed between two slash (/) characters. The order of
the name parts should be the order that the person would, by custom of their culture, have used when
giving it to a recorder. Early versions of Personal Ancestral File ® and other products did not use the
trailing slash when the surname was the last element of the name. If part of name is illegible, that part
is indicated by an ellipsis (...). Capitalize the name of a person or place in the conventional
manner—capitalize the first letter of each part and lowercase the other letters, unless conventional
usage is otherwise. For example: McMurray.
Examples:
William Lee (given name only or surname not known)
/Parry/ (surname only)
William Lee /Parry/
William Lee /Mac Parry/ (both parts (Mac and Parry) are surname parts
William /Lee/ Parry (surname imbedded in the name string)

NATIONAL_OR_TRIBAL_ORIGIN:= {Size=1:120}
The person's division of national origin or other folk, house, kindred, lineage, or tribal interest.
Examples: Irish, Swede, Egyptian Coptic, Sioux Dakota Rosebud, Apache Chiricawa, Navajo Bitter
Water, Eastern Cherokee Taliwa Wolf, and so forth.
NEW_TAG:= {Size=1:15}
A user-defined tag that is contained in the GEDCOM current transmission. This tag must begin with
an underscore (_) and should only be interpreted in the context of the sending system.
NOBILITY_TYPE_TITLE:= {Size=1:120}
The title given to or used by a person, especially of royalty or other noble class within a locality.
NULL:= {Size=0:0}
A convention that indicates the absence of any 8-bit ASCII character in the value including the null
character (0x00) which is prohibited.
50
NUMBER:=
[<DIGIT> | <NUMBER>+<DIGIT>]
OCCUPATION:= {Size=1:90}
The kind of activity that an individual does for a job, profession, or principal activity.
ORDINANCE_PROCESS_FLAG:= {Size=2:3}
[ yes | no ]
A flag that indicates whether submission should be processed for clearing temple ordinances.
PEDIGREE_LINKAGE_TYPE:= {Size=5:7}
[ adopted | birth | foster | sealing ]
A code used to indicate the child to family relationship for pedigree navigation purposes.
Where:
adopted = indicates adoptive parents.
birth = indicates birth parents.
foster = indicates child was included in a foster or guardian family.
sealing = indicates child was sealed to parents other than birth parents.
PERMANENT_RECORD_FILE_NUMBER:= {Size=1:90}
<REGISTERED_RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER>:<RECORD_IDENTIFIER>
The record number that uniquely identifies this record within a registered network resource. The
number will be usable as a cross-reference pointer. The use of the colon (:) is reserved to indicate the
separation of the "registered resource identifier" (which precedes the colon) and the unique "record
identifier" within that resource (which follows the colon). If the colon is used, implementations that
check pointers should not expect to find a matching cross-reference identifier in the transmission but
would find it in the indicated database within a network. Making resource files available to a public
network is a future implementation.
PHONE_NUMBER:= {Size=1:25}
A phone number.
PHYSICAL_DESCRIPTION:= {Size=1:248}
An unstructured list of the attributes that describe the physical characteristics of a person, place, or
object. Commas separate each attribute.
Example:
1 DSCR Hair Brown, Eyes Brown, Height 5 ft 8 in
2 DATE 23 JUL 1935
PLACE_HIERARCHY:= {Size=1:120}
This shows the jurisdictional entities that are named in a sequence from the lowest to the highest
jurisdiction. The jurisdictions are separated by commas, and any jurisdiction's name that is missing is
still accounted for by a comma. When a PLAC.FORM structure is included in the HEADER of a
GEDCOM transmission, it implies that all place names follow this jurisdictional format and each
jurisdiction is accounted for by a comma, whether the name is known or not. When the PLAC.FORM
is subordinate to an event, it temporarily overrides the implications made by the PLAC.FORM
structure stated in the HEADER. This usage is not common and, therefore, not encouraged. It should
only be used when a system has over-structured its place-names.
51
PLACE_LIVING_ORDINANCE:= {Size=1:120}
<PLACE_VALUE>
The locality of the place where a living LDS ordinance took place. Usually only a living LDS
baptism place is recorded in this field.
PLACE_VALUE:= {Size=1:120}
[
<TEXT> |
<TEXT>, <PLACE_VALUE>
]
The jurisdictional name of the place where the event took place. Jurisdictions are separated by
commas, for example, "Cove, Cache, Utah, USA." If the actual jurisdictional names of these places
have been identified, they can be shown using a PLAC.FORM structure either in the HEADER or in
the event structure. (See <PLACE_HIERARCHY>, page 51.)
POSSESSIONS:= {Size=1:248}
A list of possessions (real estate or other property) belonging to this individual.
PUBLICATION_DATE:= {Size=10:11}
<DATE_EXACT>
The date this source was published or created.
RECEIVING_SYSTEM_NAME:= {Size=1:20}
The name of the system expected to process the GEDCOM-compatible transmission. The registered
RECEIVING_SYSTEM_NAME for all GEDCOM submissions to the Family History Department
must be one of the following names:
 "ANSTFILE" when submitting to Ancestral File.
 "TempleReady" when submitting for temple ordinance clearance.
RECORD_IDENTIFIER:= {Size=1:18}
An identification number assigned to each record within a specific database. The database to which
the RECORD_IDENTIFIER pertains is indicated by the REGISTERED_RESOURCE_NUMBER
which precedes the colon (:). If the RECORD_IDENTIFIER is not preceded by a colon, it is a
reference to a record within the current GEDCOM transmission.
RECORD_TYPE:= {Size=3:4}
[ FAM | INDI | NOTE | OBJE | REPO | SOUR | SUBM | SUBN ]
An indicator of the record type being pointed to or used. For example if in an ASSOciation, an
INDIvidual record were to be ASSOciated with a FAM record then:
0 INDI
1 ASSO @F1@
2 TYPE FAM /* ASSOCIATION is with a FAM record.
2 RELA Witness at marriage
REGISTERED_RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER:= {Size=1:25}
This is an identifier assigned to a resource database that is available through access to a network. This
is for future GEDCOM releases.
52
RELATION_IS_DESCRIPTOR:= {Size=1:25}
A word or phrase that states object 1's relation is object 2. For example you would read the following
as "Joe Jacob's great grandson is the submitter pointed to by the @XREF:SUBM@":
0 INDI
1 NAME Joe /Jacob/
1 ASSO @<XREF:SUBM>@
2 TYPE great grandson
RELIGIOUS_AFFILIATION:= {Size=1:90}
A name of the religion with which this person, event, or record was affiliated.
RESPONSIBLE_AGENCY:= {Size=1:120}
The organization, institution, corporation, person, or other entity that has authority or control interests
in the associated context. For example, an employer of a person of an associated occupation, or a
church that administered rites or events, or an organization responsible for creating and/or archiving
records.
RESTRICTION_NOTICE:= {Size=6:7}
[ locked | privacy ]
The restriction notice is defined for Ancestral File usage. Ancestral File download GEDCOM files
may contain this data.
Where:
locked = Some records in Ancestral File have been satisfactorily proven by evidence, but because
of source conflicts or incorrect traditions, there are repeated attempts to change this
record. By arrangement, the Ancestral File Custodian can lock a record so that it cannot
be changed without an agreement from the person assigned as the steward of such a
record. The assigned steward is either the submitter listed for the record or Family
History Support when no submitter is listed.
privacy = Information concerning this record is not present due to rights of or an approved request
for privacy.
ROLE_DESCRIPTOR:= {Size=1:25}
A word or phrase that identifies a person's role in an event being described. This should be the same
word or phrase, and in the same language, that the recorder used to define the role in the actual
record.
ROLE_IN_EVENT:= {Size=1:15}
[ CHIL | HUSB | WIFE | MOTH | FATH | SPOU | (<ROLE_DESCRIPTOR>) ]
Indicates what role this person played in the event that is being cited in this context. For example, if
you cite a child's birth record as the source of the mother's name, the value for this field is "MOTH."
If you describe the groom of a marriage, the role is "HUSB." If the role is something different than
one of the six relationship role tags listed above then enclose the role name within matching
parentheses.
SCHOLASTIC_ACHIEVEMENT:= {Size=1:248}
A description of a scholastic or educational achievement or pursuit.
53
SEX_VALUE:= {Size=1:7}
A code that indicates the sex of the individual:

A number assigned to a person in the United States for identification purposes.
SOURCE_CALL_NUMBER:= {Size=1:120}
An identification or reference description used to file and retrieve items from the holdings of a
repository.
SOURCE_DESCRIPTION:= {Size=1:248}
A free form text block used to describe the source from which information was obtained. This text
block is used by those systems which cannot use a pointer to a source record. It must contain a
descriptive title, who created the work, where and when it was created, and where is source data
stored. The developer should encourage users to use an appropriate style for forming this free form
bibliographic reference. Developers are encouraged to support the SOURCE_RECORD method of
reporting bibliographic reference descriptions.
SOURCE_DESCRIPTIVE_TITLE:= {Size=1:248}
The title of the work, record, or item and, when appropriate, the title of the larger work or series of
which it is a part.
For a published work, a book for example, might have a title plus the title of the series of which the
book is a part. A magazine article would have a title plus the title of the magazine that published the
article.
For An unpublished work, such as:
 A letter might include the date, the sender, and the receiver.
 A transaction between a buyer and seller might have their names and the transaction date.
 A family Bible containing genealogical information might have past and present owners and a
physical description of the book.
 A personal interview would cite the informant and interviewer.
SOURCE_FILED_BY_ENTRY:= {Size= 1:60}
This entry is to provide a short title used for sorting, filing, and retrieving source records.
SOURCE_JURISDICTION_PLACE:= {Size=1:120}
<PLACE_VALUE>
The name of the lowest jurisdiction that encompasses all lower-level places named in this source.
For example, "Oneida, Idaho" would be used as a source jurisdiction place for events occurring in the
various towns within Oneida County. "Idaho" would be the source jurisdiction place if the events
recorded took place in other counties as well as Oneida County.
SOURCE_MEDIA_TYPE:= {Size=1:15}
[ audio | book | card | electronic | fiche | film | magazine |
manuscript | map | newspaper | photo | tombstone | video ]
54
A code, selected from one of the media classifications choices above, that indicates the type of
material in which the referenced source is stored.
SOURCE_ORIGINATOR:= {Size=1:248}
The person, agency, or entity who created the record. For a published work, this could be the author,
compiler, transcriber, abstractor, or editor. For an unpublished source, this may be an individual, a
government agency, church organization, or private organization, etc.
SOURCE_PUBLICATION_FACTS:= {Size=248}
When and where the record was created. For published works, this includes information such as the
city of publication, name of the publisher, and year of publication.
For an unpublished work, it includes the date the record was created and the place where it was
created. For example, the county and state of residence of a person making a declaration for a pension
or the city and state of residence of the writer of a letter.
SUBMITTER_NAME:= {Size=1:60}
The name of the submitter formatted for display and address generation.
SUBMITTER_REGISTERED_RFN:= {Size=1:30}
A registered number of a submitter of Ancestral File data. This number is used in subsequent
submissions or inquiries by the submitter for identification purposes.
SUBMITTER_TEXT:= {Size=1:248}
Comments or opinions from the submitter.
TEMPLE_CODE:= {Size=4:5}
An abbreviation of the temple in which LDS temple ordinances were performed. (See Appendix C,
page 85.)
TEXT:= {Size=1:248}
A string composed of any valid character from the GEDCOM character set.
TEXT_FROM_SOURCE:= {Size=1:248}
<TEXT>
A verbatim copy of any description contained within the source. This indicates notes or text that are
actually contained in the source document, not the submitter's opinion about the source. This should
be, from the evidence point of view, "what the original record keeper said" as opposed to the
researcher's interpretation. The word TEXT, in this case, means from the text which appeared in the
source record including labels.
TIME_VALUE:= {Size=1:12}
[ hh:mm:ss.fs ]
The time of a specific event, usually a computer-timed event, where:
hh = hours on a 24-hour clock
mm = minutes
ss = seconds (optional)
fs = decimal fraction of a second (optional)
55
TRANSMISSION_DATE:= {Size=10:11}
<DATE_EXACT>
The date that this transmission was created.
USER_REFERENCE_NUMBER:= {Size=1:20}
A user-defined number or text that the submitter uses to identify this record. For instance, it may be a
record number within the submitter's automated or manual system, or it may be a page and position
number on a pedigree chart.
USER_REFERENCE_TYPE:= {Size=1:40}
A user-defined definition of the USER_REFERENCE_NUMBER.
VERSION_NUMBER:= {Size=1:15}
An identifier that represents the version level assigned to the associated product. It is defined and
changed by the creators of the product.
WHERE_WITHIN_SOURCE:= {Size=1:248}
Specific location with in the information referenced. For a published work, this could include the
volume of a multi-volume work and the page number(s). For a periodical, it could include volume,
issue, and page numbers. For a newspaper, it could include a column number and page number. For
an unpublished source, this could be a sheet number, page number, frame number, etc. A census
record might have a line number or dwelling and family numbers in addition to the page number.
XREF:= {Size=1:22}
Either a pointer or an unique cross-reference identifier. If this element appears before the tag in a
GEDCOM line, then it is a cross-reference identifier. If it appears after the tag in a GEDCOM line,
then it is a pointer. The method of delimiting a pointer or cross-reference identifier is to enclose the
pointer or cross-reference identifier within at signs (@), for example, @I123@. A XREF may not
begin with a number sign (#). This is to avoid confusion with an escape sequence prefix (@#). The
use of a colon (:) in the XREF is reserved for creating future network cross-references and the use of
an exclamation (!) is reserved for intra-record pointers. Uniqueness of the cross-reference identifier is
required within the transmission file.
XREF:FAM:= {Size=1:22}
A pointer to, or a cross-reference identifier of, a fam_record.
XREF:INDI:= {Size=1:22}
A pointer to, or a cross-reference identifier of, an individual record.

XREF:SUBM:= {Size=1:22}
A pointer to, or a cross-reference identifier of, a SUBMitter record.
XREF:SUBN:= {Size=1:22}
A pointer to, or a cross-reference identifier of, a SUBmissioN record.
YEAR:= {Size=3:4}
A numeric representation of the calendar year in which an event occurred.
YEAR_GREG:= {Size=3:7}
[ <NUMBER> | <NUMBER>/<DIGIT><DIGIT> ]
The slash "/" <DIGIT><DIGIT> a year modifier which shows the possible date alternatives for pre-
1752 date brought about by a changing the beginning of the year from MAR to JAN in the English
calendar change of 1752, for example, 15 APR 1699/00. A (B.C.) appended to the <YEAR> indicates
a date before the birth of Christ.

&RPSDWLELOLW\ZLWK2WKHU*('&209HUVLRQV
GEDCOM compatibility is measured on a per tag basis, and depends on how similar the data models are
for the two different communicating products and on how consistently they understood and complied
with the GEDCOM Standard. A few inconsistencies in the use of specific tags also crept into different
releases of the standard itself, due to lack of foresight or inadvertent errors. Within these limits,
GEDCOM compatible products can exchange data based on GEDCOM 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, and 5.x. Of course,
newer GEDCOM releases significantly extend the data model for which the newer tag contexts will not
be supported by older products. Some products have introduced their own variations into their
GEDCOM form. This will likely provide unique problems with compatibility.
The following are areas in which incompatibilities may arise:
 Source Structure:
The SOURce structure was not supported by GEDCOM in versions before 5.x. However, some
products, prior to GEDCOM 5.x, developed a SOURce structure for citing sources. These structures
varied from product to product, which affects how source citations are interpreted. Products based on
5.x GEDCOM, prior to GEDCOM 5.4, may have used the more detailed source structure suggested
by the previous 5.x versions. Older systems already handling sources will need to be modified.
GEDCOM 5.x draft products are encouraged to update their programs to The GEDCOM Standard 5.5
as soon as possible.
 FAMC Pointer:
The INDI.FAMC structure has been modified a lot since GEDCOM 4.0. In previous GEDCOM 5.x
versions the FAMC structure may contain subordinate adoption events and/or LDS sealing to parent
events. See the compatibility implications concerning the LDS sealing to parent event treated in the
"LDS Ordinances Dates" in the next paragraph.
 LDS Ordinance Dates:
The structure for LDS sealing of child to parent was changed in previous GEDCOM 5.x draft
versions from the FAM.CHIL.SLGC structure to the INDI.FAMC.SLGC structure. This was to allow
access to child sealing information without having to follow a pointer to the family record. Personal
Ancestral File 2.31 writes the sealing date in the FAM.CHIL.SLGC structure but reads this
information from either format. A new major release of Personal Ancestral File will change to the
newer approach.
GEDCOM 5.4 places the sealing of child to parent event at the same level as all of the other events
that are subordinate to the INDIvidual tag. If a system is keeping track of which family the
individual is sealed to, then a FAMC pointer is additionally inserted subordinate to the SLGC event
tag that points to the sealed-to-family.
To accommodate previous GEDCOM imports, systems handling the LDS ordinance events should
look for the child sealing information in either INDI.SLGC (see LDS_INDIVIDUAL_ORDINANCE
page 32, INDI.FAMC.SLGC or FAM.CHIL.SLGC structures. Ancestral File exports did not
separate the temple code from the ordinance date. Ordinance dates down-loaded from Ancestral File
may contain an ordinance date followed by a two digit temple code rather than a separate temple code
line.
58
GEDCOM 4.x systems used certain key words as part of the ordinance dates. GEDCOM 5.x
separated these codes from the dates and specified that they should be values of a subordinate
STATus tag. Previous GEDCOM 5.x implementations may have implemented this feature using a
TYPE tag instead of the STATus tag. (See <LDS_(ordinance)_DATE_STATUS>, page 45, 46.)
 Adoption Events:
In GEDCOM 5.x, the ADOPtion event was moved from the FAM.CHIL structure to the
INDI.FAMC.ADOP structure, it also appears in the INDI.ADOP structure. In GEDCOM 5.4 the
ADOPtion event appears only as an individual event which optionally contains a FAMC pointer to
the adoptive family. Subordinate to this pointer is another ADOPtion tag which indicates whether
the HUSB or WIFE in the pointed at family was the adoptive parent (see
<ADOPTED_BY_WHICH_PARENTS> primitive on page 37). Pedigree navigation is provided only
by <<CHILD_TO_FAMILY_LINK>> structure found on page 29.
 Codes in Event Date:
Some applications, such as Personal Ancestral File, pass key words as part of certain event dates.
Some of these key words were INFANT, CHILD, STILLBORN, etc. These have to do with being an
approximate age at an event.
In this version of GEDCOM, the information has been removed from the date value and specified by
an <AGE_AT_EVENT> key word value which indicates a descriptive age value at the time of the
enclosing event. (See <AGE_AT_EVENT>, page 37.) For example:
1 DEAT
2 DATE 13 MAY 1984
2 AGE STILLBORN
meaning this person died at age approximately 0 days old.
1 DEAT
2 DATE 13 MAY 1984
2 AGE INFANT
meaning this person died at age less than 1 year old.
 Multiple Names:
GEDCOM 5.x requires listing different names in different NAME structures, with the preferred
instance first, followed by less preferred names. However, Personal Ancestral File and other products
that only handle one name may use only the last instance of a name from a GEDCOM transmission.
This causes the preferred name to be dropped when more than one name is present. The same thing
often happens with other multiple-instance tags when only one instance was expected by the
receiving system. PAF and other products that handle one name only may drop the preferred name
under this arrangement.
 Alias Names:
One or two systems used the ALIAs tag for representing multiple names. This form is not supported
in the GEDCOM Standard version 5.5.
 Event Structure:
The address structure, as part of the place structure, provided more detail than desired for the PLACe
structure. Therefore it was removed from beneath the place structure and added to the
<<EVENT_DETAIL>> structure at the same level as PLACe. The SITE tag was also eliminated
59
from the PLACe structure since the site of an event is really part of an address, such as Primary
Children's Hospital, 100N Medical Drive, Salt Lake City, Utah.
 Supplemental Attributes or Facts:
Sometimes other attributes or facts are used to describe an individual's actions, physical description,
employment, education, places of residence, etc. These are not generally thought of as events.
However, they are often described like events because they were observed at a particular time and/or
place. GEDCOM 5.x lists these attributes under the
<<INDIVIDUAL_ATTRIBUTE_STRUCTURE>> on page 31 and allows them to be recorded in the
same way as events. The attribute definition allows a value on the same line as the attribute tag. In
addition, it allows a subordinate date period, place and/or address, etc. to be transmitted, just as the
events are. Previous versions, which handled just a tag and value, can be read as usual by handling
the subordinate attribute detail as an exception.
3DFNDJLQJWKH*('&207UDQVPLVVLRQ)LOH
The GEDCOM transmission is normally created on a DOS or Macintosh® compatible diskette. The DOS
filename extension is (.GED). Macintosh filenames do not use file extensions.
When the GEDCOM file is too large to fit on a single diskette, the file is divided after any whole-line
(last character is the terminator), and the DOS filename extension becomes (G##) where (##) is (00) for
the second disk, (01) for the third, and so forth. For Macintosh filenames, append the two digits to the
subsequent filenames in parentheses. (See the example below.) This allows the receiving software to
ensure that disks are read in the correct sequence.
Given that the user-supplied portion of the file name is SMITH, then the complete filenames for a threedisk
transmission would be:
Disk DOS Filename Macintosh Filename
1 SMITH.GED SMITH
2 SMITH.G00 SMITH(00)
3 SMITH.G01 SMITH(01)
The required GEDCOM HEADer record appears only on the first disk and the required TRLR (trailer)
record appears only on the last disk and must be followed by the terminator.
User-Defined Tags
We do not encourage the use of user-defined GEDCOM tags. Applications requiring the use of nonstandard
tags should define them with a leading underscore so that they will not conflict with future
GEDCOM standard tags. Systems that read user-defined tags must consider that they have meaning only
with respect to a system contained in the HEAD.SOUR context.
Escape Sequence Format for the Lineage-Linked Form
The Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form no longer uses the escape sequence feature provided in the
GEDCOM grammar.
60
6DPSOH/LQHDJH/LQNHG*('&207UDQVPLVVLRQ
The example below shows how some of these value types appear in a valid GEDCOM lineage-linked
transmission. The example is a sample transmission of genealogical information about three individuals
who are members of the same family—father, mother, and child. In the example, "Joe/Williams/" is the
value specified by the tag NAME under the INDI tag for the record (@3@). Other values in other lines,
such as the birth date and place, provide additional information about Joe Williams. The value (@4@)
specified by the FAMC tag is a pointer to the FAM_RECORD (@4@) of which Joe Williams is a child.
Included also in this transmission example are three other record types: a source record, a submitter
record, and a repository record. These records are pointed to from within other records in the
transmission. This shows how pointer values can be used in creating Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form.

Introduction
GEDCOM needs to accommodate different character sets to facilitate the sharing of genealogical data in
different languages. To minimize the number of differing standards, we have chosen to have each system
convert its usage to ANSEL, and eventually to UNICODE.
In January 1991, a Unicode Consortium was founded to promote the use of the Unicode standard, which
accommodates most all characters in one character set. (See the section "Unicode," on page 64.) The
Unicode Consortium has agreed with the ISO 10646 standard to merge, and Unicode will be a subset of
the ISO 10646 international character encoding standard.
Currently, it is difficult to handle the two- and four-character code sequences (wide characters).
Therefore, until multi-byte handling becomes more common, ANSEL will be used to represent Latinbased
characters.
The GEDCOM Standard does not address the implementation methods for multilingual processing, such
as keyboard arrangements, sorting sequences, or character and graphic representations (font styles,
proportional spacing, and so forth) on the CRT or printers. However, the Unicode standard has defined
formatting characters that will indicate the direction of the text presentation and other text formatting
character code.
Systems using code pages to support diacritical characters must convert all characters above character
codes 128 to its ANSEL representation for that code page.
Most of the genealogy systems developed so far use ASCII, ANSEL, or both. ANSEL accommodates
the set of Latin-based languages, as explained below.
%LW$16(/
The 8-Bit ANSEL (American National Standard for Extended Latin Alphabet Coded Character Set for
Bibliographic Use, Z39.47-1985 copyright) is the preferred character set for GEDCOM. It is used for all
transmissions of information unless another character set is specified.
Using this character set standard makes it possible to preserve the full integrity of the language by
providing a method of using the standard ASCII character set and supplementing it with both nonspacing
character modifiers (diacritic) as well as spacing special characters.
Note:Non-spacing means that the diacritic is printed without advancing the device's print position. The
character being modified is then printed in the same position, resulting in a combined image of both the
character and the diacritic(s).
Storing ANSEL requires storing the non-spacing graphic character(s) preceding the ASCII character that
the diacritic is to modify. The ANSEL standard specifies an extended 8-bit configuration (above 128) to
represent the spacing and non-spacing graphic characters that make up most of the Latin based
64
languages. ANSEL is a super-set of ASCII. The standard ASCII characters including the control
characters are preserved.
ANSEL is known by two other names:
 ANSI Z39.47-1985
 American Library Association character set, used in library systems worldwide, including the
MARC (Machine-Readable Catalog) format.
A description of the codes for the ANSEL character set has been reproduced with permission and is
included with the printed version of The GEDCOM Standard. The description of ANSEL codes is not
included in the electronic version. This description may be purchased from—

The description of the ANSEL character set standard includes the following:
 An 8-Bit Code Table showing the ASCII and extended ANSEL codes
 An explanation or legend of these codes
 A chart that identifies the ANSEL Non-spacing Graphic Characters
 A chart that identifies the ASCII Control Characters
 A chart that identifies the ASCII Graphic Characters
Character set codes 0 through 127 are the same for 8-Bit ANSEL and 8-Bit ASCII (USA version—ANSI
8-Bit). Character set codes 128 through 255 are unique to the ANSEL character set.

When a language does not need diacritic characters or other special characters, and if you are not
transmitting binary data, you will find it convenient to use ASCII (8-bit USA version) if your computer
already supports it. This is a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). Most of the
basic printable characters of ANSEL and ASCII (USA version—ANSI 8-Bit) are identical.

The Unicode standard is a new character code designed to encode text for storage in computer files. It is
a subset of the upcoming ISO 10646 standard. The design of the Unicode standard is based on the
simplicity and consistency of today's prevalent character code set, extended ASCII code set, but goes far
beyond ASCII's limited ability to encode only the Latin alphabet: the Unicode encoding provides the
capacity to encode most all of the characters used for written languages throughout the world. In order to
accommodate the many thousands of characters used in the international text, the Unicode standard uses
a 16-bit code set instead of extended ASCII's 8-bit code set. This expansion provides codes for
approximately 65,000 characters. The Unicode standard assigns each character a unique 16-bit value,
and does not use complex modes or escape codes to specify modified characters or special cases.
UNICODE may adopt a 32-bit code to represent characters which should allow for all character
representations. The text representation of the Unicode 16-bit numbers is U+0041 which is assigned to
the letter A, 65 decimal. The Unicode standard includes the Latin alphabet used for English, the Cyrillic
alphabet used for Russian, the Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic alphabets. Other alphabets used in countries
65
across Europe, Africa, the Indian subcontinent, and Asia, such as Japanese Kana, Korean Hangul, and
Chinese Bopomofo are included. The largest part of the Unicode standard is devoted to thousands of
unified character codes for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ideographs. (See "The Unicode standard",
vol. 1 and 2, published by Addison-Wesley Publishing, for character code standards.)
The Unicode character set environment should eventually contain a set of character for all languages. If
the Unicode environment is used to produce a GEDCOM transmission, the header record would also be
in Unicode, requiring receiving systems to determine whether the transmission is Unicode or ASCII
before they could interpret the GEDCOM header. This would be done by reading the first two bytes of
the transmission. If the first two bytes are 0x30 and 0x20 then the transmission will be in either ASCII
or ANSEL as determined by the header record. If the first two bytes are 0x30 and 0x00 then the
transmission should be processed as a Unicode transmission. (Different platforms may reverse the
position of the null byte, in which case the test would be for 0x00 and 0x30.)
How to Change Character Sets
The character set for an entire transmission is specified in the character set line of the header record.
The example below shows the specification in the header record:
Lvl Tag Value
0 HEAD
1 SOUR PAF
2 VERS 2.1
1 DEST ANSTFILE
1 CHAR ANSEL
The character set change remains in effect until the TRLR record is encountered at the end of the
transmission.
UNICODE character set should be used for multi-language support as soon as operating systems begin
providing adequate storage and display support.

Appendix A
Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Tag Definition
Introduction
Appendix A is a glossary of the tags used in the Lineage-Linked GEDCOM Form. These tags are used
in a hierarchal structure to describe individuals in terms of their families, names, dates, places, events,
roles, sources, relationships. Control information and other kinds of data intended for computer
processing is also included. (An example of the tags used in the Lineage-Linked Form begins on page
60.) To ensure all transmitted information in the Lineage-Linked GEDCOM is uniformly identified the
standardized tags cannot be placed in any other context than shown in Chapter 2. It is legal to extend the
context of the form, but only by using user-defined tags which must begin with an underscore. This will
not violate the lineage-linked GEDCOM standard unless the context for the grammar of the Lineage-
Linked GEDCOM Form is violated. The use of the underscore in the user tag name is to signal a nonstandard
construct is being used. This notifies the reading system of a discrepancy and will avoid future
conflicts with tags that may be standardized in subsequent GEDCOM releases.

ANSEL Character Set
The following tables show the spacing and non-spacing diacritic characters that are contained in the ANSEL set required by
the languages supported by GEDCOM 5. This table was added to give help to those receiving the GEDCOM standard on
disk. The graphic characters shown are not always accurate, however the name of the diacritic and the decimal equivalent
should agree with the ANSEL standard.
 C/R column refers to the column and row of the American National Standard Z39.47-1985 table showing the ANSEL
character graphic and its 8 bit binary representation.
 wpcode column shows the Wordperfect (code page and character number, for example 1,2) chosen as the closest
representation of the diacritic as shown in Wordperfect 5.1 Appendix P.
 Dec column shows to the decimal equivalent for that diacritic as is used in the ANSEL character set. The hexadecimal
equivalent is obtained from converting the C/R column in to a to character hexadecimal number, for example 14/10
converts to EA hex or 234 dec.
 Name column gives the english name of the diacritic.
 example of use column shows an example of words using this diacritic. For the non-spacing diacritic, this mark appears
before the character in which it should be superimposed.

APPENDIX E
Encoding and Decoding Algorithms
for Multimedia Objects
Introduction:
Embedded multimedia objects in GEDCOM requires special handling. These objects are
normally represented by binary files containing characters which interfere with data
transmission protocols. This document describes how the binary characters are encoded for
transmission and then decoded to rebuild the multimedia file.
The algorithm for encoding binary images, compatible with GEDCOM transmission, is
similar to an encoding scheme that would be used in creating a hexadecimal representation,
but it uses a base-64 number representation rather than base-16 number representation.
Encoding:
This algorithm is for converting multimedia images represented in binary numbers into a
collection that does not contain any of the ASCII control characters. This conversion
eliminates the occurrence of special characters such as the "@" which has special meaning
to GEDCOM.
The encoding routine converts a binary multimedia file segment of from 1 to 54 bytes in
length into an encoded GEDCOM line value of 2 to 64 bytes in length. This encoded value
becomes the <ENCODED_MULTIMEDIA_LINE> used in the MULTIMEDIA_RECORD
(see page 26.)
The algorithm accomplishes its goal using the following steps:
1. Each 3 bytes (24 bits) of the binary 1 to 54 character segment is divided into four (6-
bit) values. Each of these (6-bit) values are converted into an (8-bit) character making
a character whose hexadecimal representation is between 0x00 and 0x3F (0 to 63
decimal.)
2. Each of the 4 new characters represents an Encoding key which is used to obtain the
new replacement character from an Encoding Table included in this appendix.
3. Exception processing may be required in processing the last 3 byte chunk of the 1 to
54 character segment, which may consist of 0, 1, or 2 bytes:
92
Retrieved Action
a. 0 bytes Pad the last 3 characters with 0xFF. The conversion is complete.
b. 1 byte: Pad last two bytes with 0xFF then complete steps 1 and 2 above.
c. 2 bytes: Pad last byte with 0xFF then complete steps 1 and 2 above.
5. Repeat until all characters in the received line value has been substituted. The return
value of new encoded characters should contain from 4 to 72 characters. The length
of the return value will always be a multiple of 4.
Decoding:
The Decoding routine converts the encoded line value back into the original binary character
multimedia file segment.
The decoding algorithm can be accomplished in the following steps:
1. Each encoded multimedia line segment is divided into sets of 4 (8-bit) characters.
2. Each of these characters becomes a decoding key used to look up a corresponding
character from the Decoding Table. A new (24-bit) group is formed by
concatenating the low-order 6 bits from each of the 4 characters obtained from the
decoding table.
3. Divide this new 24 bit group created by step 2 into three (8-bit) characters and
concatenate them into the stream of characters being built as the decoded results.
4. Processing ends when the 0xFF padded bytes are encountered.
