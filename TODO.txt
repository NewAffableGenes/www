When exporting GED file - dont write lines for text where strlen = 0

// If Root is not set in the GED (i.e. the file is not from Affable Genes) call a dialog to select Root at end of import then call
// show_as_many_as_possible()

// Consider having an alert for hacking - ie attempting to access trees etc that don't belong or where there are no rights - Lock out session?
// In db_typing - Speed it up and allow stricter testing - e.g. string max and min lengths
// Change subscription extension to give 3 months at a time
// Minimise calls to error display - If its a call that should not have been made - ie probably hacking - just die quietly or ignore!
// Call check_tree (expanded) after GEDCOM import
// Add menu item in Tree browse to run show_as_many_as_possible() and call it 'Auto Format' - To do the best we can to show as many as possible!!
// When exporting do I need both SURN etc and NAME as Adrian's
// Add ability to select (default = yes) UTF-8 first 3 bytes to be added to GED file export
// One day split up functions.php to minimise computing overhead?
// Add a whole bunch of comments especially to describe what the includes all do - globals.php, function.php, header.php, etc

TESTING:
// TEST: All database functions
// TEST: Import should only look for _EXTENSIONS where originating software is declared as Affable Genes? - DONE but needs testing
// TEST: When importing GEDCOM only do the default box text if it doesn't already exist - DONE but needs testing
